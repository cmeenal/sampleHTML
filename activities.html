		<h2 class="heading" >Dance</h2>

		<P>
			Dance is a wonderful activity for kids, capable of fostering a positive self image in both girls and boys. Dance lessons can teach a child self confidence, self discipline, poise and grace. Most importantly, dancing is lots of fun!
		</P>
		<P>
			We introduce children to the joy of dancing. Children develop many skills as they develop a natural love of dance like: coordination, balance, creativity, imagination, language and listening, rhythm, self-esteem and body awareness. Our energetic teachers share their passion and love of music and movement.

		<h2 class="heading">Art and Craft</h2>
		<P>
			Children LOVE arts and craft! Children love to draw, color, paint and interpret the world in their own ways. It is not necessarily about the end product but the creative journey of the activity that they follow to create their own masterpiece. Our art activities capture the child's interest and gently increases their focus and attention span.
		</P>
		<P>
			An art class is teacher built but child approved in a simple, structured way to ensure that the children blossom into little artisits.
		</P>
		<P>
			Children will enjoy drawing, painting, coloring, cutting, crumpling, scrunching, threading, lacing sticking and pasting, moulding, laughing, and of course, making new friends!
